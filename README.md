# Tile-tutorial

This is the code for my [tower defense tutorial](https://idiotcoder/com/tower).  
Assets are courtesy of [foozle](https://foozlecc.itch.io/) on itch.io.

UI assets are from the great [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/assets/ui-pack-rpg-expansion).

All assets are embedded, so you will not need to distribute them seperately.
